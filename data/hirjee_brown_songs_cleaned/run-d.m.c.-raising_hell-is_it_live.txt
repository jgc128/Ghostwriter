Intro:

[Run & D.M.C]
 
The microphone master DMC
Causes 1, 2, 3, 4 casualties
You'll be praisin D down on your knees
Cos I'm poppin, and droppin, stoppin all MC's


Verse One: 

[Run]

Connect, eject, and collect respect
Get down to the sound cos I come correct
So when I write don't bite and I might check
And if I find your behind I'll break your neck
Mr. World Rhymin' Rapper ready to have fun
You'll reason with the rekkid cos it's made by Run
It's def, you was left in a total stun
So bust a move while I prove who's number one
Got quality and skill both beyond belief
Do I steal? Be for real, I'm not a thief
Dictator and hater of those that beef
That's right I can fight and I'm the chief
 

Verse Two:

[DMC]

People in the place don't put D down
I'm the microphone master the best around
There's not too many of my type
And all rap titles I will swipe
You'll see me talkin to a girl
A sweet young thing with jheri curls
I never ever wore a braid
Got the peasiest hair and still get paid
 
[Run]

Well I'm dropping MC's with just one punch
Cos it's the baddest of the bunch so call me Capt. Crunch
Slayin MC's, make em walk the plank
And what's next, start the decks while I count I count my bank

[DMC]

And I'm the wizard of words, the ruler of rap
Not soft, not a sucka, could never be a sap
You might get jacked cos you talk crap
When I bust my rap they all step back
I'm paid on stage, Run's on my left
On his right, on the mic, I recite I'm def
Because every performer is only a goner
Keep all sissy soft suckas off my corner
 
(Scratch: LL Cool J "Is it live?")

Cos Darryl Mac will do things like that...
 

Verse Three:

[Run]

The sophisticated sound, not soft or sour
It's servin you suckas, sellin dreams in the shower
It's rockin this party hour, hour after hour
If a girlie tried to diss this (What's up with that?)
I won't allow her
Cool chief rapper, I see a girl I tap her
Then I take her on the floor, she don't dance, I slap her
The girl starts to cry and the crowd asks me why
If Run says "dance" you do or die!
