   Verse 1
   
   (One) day when I was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
   Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
   This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
   Went up to the front with a menu and his money
   He didn't walk straight, kind of side to side
   He asked this old lady, "Yo, yo, um...is this Kentucky Fried?"
   The lady said "Yeah", smiled and he smiled back
   He gave a quarter and his order, small fries, Big Mac!
   You be illin'
   
   Verse 2
   
   (To)day you won a ticket to see Doctor J
   Front row seat (in free!) no pay
   Radio in hand, snacks by feet
   Game's about to start, you kickin' popcorn to the beat
   You finally wake up, Doc's gone to town
   Round his back, through the hoop, then you scream "Touchdown!"
   You be illin'
   
   Verse 3
   
   The other day around the way I seen you illin' at a party
   Drunk as skunk you illin' punk and in your left hand was Bacardi
   You went up to this fly girl and said "Yo, yo, can I get this dance?"
   She smelt your breath and then she left you standin' in your illin'
   stance
   You be illin'
   
   Verse 4
   
   (For) dinner, you ate it, there is none left
   It was salty, with butter and it was def
   You proceeded to eat it cos you was in the mood
   But holmes you did not read it was a can of dog food!
   You be illin'
