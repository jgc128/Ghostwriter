Artist: Boogie Down Productions
Album:  Criminal Minded
Song:   Poetry

Verse One: KRS-One

Well now you're forced to listen to the teacher and the lesson
Class is in session so you can stop guessin
If this is a tape or a written down memo
See I am a professional, this is not a demo
In fact call it a lecture, a visual picture
Sort of a poetic and rhythm-like mixture
Listen, I'm not dissin but there's somethin that you're missin
Maybe you should touch reality, stop wishin
For beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste
If this meaning doesn't manifest put it to rest
I am a poet, you try to show it, yet blow it
It takes concentration for fresh communication
Observation, that is to see without speaking
Take off your coat, take notes, I am teachin
a class, or rather school, cause you need schooling
I am not a king or queen, I'm not ruling
This is an introduction to poetry
A small dedication to those that might know of me
They might know of you and maybe your gang
But one thing's for sure, neither one of y'all can hang
Cause yo I'm like a arrow, and Scott is the crossbow
Say something now ... thought so
You seem to be the type that only understand
The annihilation and destruction of the next man
That's not poetry, that is insanity
It's simply fantasy far from reality
Poetry is the language of imagination
Poetry is a form of positive creation
Difficult, isn't it?  The point?  You're missin it
Your face is in front of my hand so I'm dissin it

Verse Two: KRS-One

Scott LaRock is innovating, decorating hip-hop
The beat may drop but not like all the others
They just cover while I just smother
Every single stupid mutha -- wait wait brotha
KRS-One will have to show another
MC or self-proclaimed king or queen
Or gang or crew or solo or team
That I mean
Business
So tell me what is this?
See I come from the Bronx so just kiss this
Boogie Down Productions is somewhat an experiment
The antidote for sucka MC's and they're fearin it
It's self-explanatory, no one's writin for me
The poetry I'm rattlin is really not for battlin
But if you want I will simply change the program
So when I'm done you will simply say "damn"
So this conversation is somewhat hypothetical
Boogie Down Productions attempts to prove somethin
I say hypothetical because it's only theory
My theory, so take a minute now to hear me

Verse Three: KRS-One

So what's your problem?
It seems you want to be KRS-Two
From my point of view, backtrack, stop the attack
Cos KRS-One means simply one KRS
That's it, that's all, solo, single, no more, no less
I've built up my credential financially and mental
Anytime I rhyme I request the instrumental
I speak clearly and that's merely
Or should I say a mere, help to my career
I'm really not into fashion or craze
Just the one who pays and how soon I get a raise
You're probably in a daze, acting out of sympathy
Wrote a couple of rhymes and think that you can get with me
But what a pity, I'm rockin New York City
And everywhere else, you put the jams on the shelf
You as an amateur is outspoken
I'm looking at your face, you seem to be hopin
That I might stutter, stop, or just mess up
But everything's live that's why I don't dress up
"Blastmaster KRS" a synonym for "fresh"
I'm the teacher of the class, I do not pass no test
Got DJ Scott LaRock by my side, not in back of me
Cos we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew faculty
Get it right, or train yourself not to bite
Cos when you bite you have bitten, when I hear it, that's it
I do not contemplate a battle cause it really ain't worth it
I'd rather point a pistol at your head and try to burst it

I'm teaching poetry
I'm teaching poetry
Scott LaRock
We're teaching po-e-try
