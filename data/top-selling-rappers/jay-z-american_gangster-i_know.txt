And I Know And I Know
And I Know And I Know
(I know what you like)

(I know what you love)
Everything you like 
Everything you love 
Everything you like
Everything you love
And I Know And I Know
And I Know And I Know
And I Know And I Know
And I Know And I Know
I know what you like 
Everything you like

Everything you love

[Verse 1]
Uh
She wants that old thing back
Uh, uh, uh
She want those heroin tracks
She likes me
She fiends for me nightly
She leans for me
Morning she rush for my touch
This is about lust
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her
My presence is a must, must-must
Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on
If I didn't when we cuttin', the feeling would be too strong
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams
That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing
That Black Rain that take away your pain
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein
Now that feelin' got you trippin'
You no wanna feel no different
Said lust has got you itchin'
All wide open and its' drippin'(eh,eh,eh,eh)
I know what you like, I am your prescription
I'm your physician, I'm your addiction

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I am so dope
Like Louis Vuittons with the red bottoms
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em
Like every color, Giuseppe's your guilty pleasure is me
Its so much fun, you shun therapy
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
Shopping's like coppin', you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seeking
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
I keep tryin' to remind you to keep tellin' yourself
Now your conscience is interfering, like "Better yourself!"
Like you better get help
But when that medicine's felt?
We're back together
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me
My China White, 'til we D.O.A.
Its Montega forever, baby, lets get away....

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
How could you leave me?
I thought that you needed me
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me
Who helped you immediately?
How speedy of me
How could you deny me so vehemently?
Now your body is shakin' trying to free it of me
And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D

[Chorus]
