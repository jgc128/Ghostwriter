[Verse 1: Fabolous]
(BROOKLYN!!!) We right here BIG
Your boy sittin on top like a hair wig

East New York walk the Brownsville grill ill
You see I got a Fort Greene lean
Clinton Hills chill Red Hook look, man
Ain't no shook hands in Brook-lyn
Son your life can be took man (BROOKLYN!!!)
Then threw off bridges
One hard top two soft bitches
Ride through the borough with two fo' fifths
Phantom open up like two door fridges
I make 'em change the new york digits
From 718 to 187, to 212 to 211
Your boy's back with a new one son, HUH!!!!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm right here Fab, wavin the flag I'm from Nostrand Ave
I came to take the game in my Daddy Kane chain
Niggas gave it up smooth they didn't want to hear the BANG, BANG 
I'm back on my bully shit
The Flatbush Bushwick black hoodie shit
Half a billion bank roll
Bank stop anybody what's your bank hold?
Big B's on the wheel spread love the Brooklyn way B how's it feel?
I'm on my Robin Thicke shit
Shit ever get thick I'm back to robbin niggas quick
Trick, clip, ante up,  all you niggas Britney pull your panties up
Whole borough is with me hold your cannons up
Buck one for Bucktown Brooklyn what the fuck?!! Ha Ha!!!

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
I'm right here Hov! East New York Uncle Murda feelin good
I hooked up with Jigga got my grandma out the hood
Marcy is back now look at niggas
Now they can't say Jay ain't sign a Brooklyn nigga
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Shootin somebody up for gettin off the packs
Or goin to the club lookin for somethin to dap
Or runnin up in the crib like where the safe at?
East New York will shoot you they dap your homey
Brownsville will rob ya they clap your homey
Bed-Stuy will get you killed for a hundred grams
Get a Coney Island nigga to pull the trigga man (C.I. Whattup?!!!)
Ask Flex he used to run the Tunnel
Brooklyn had dudes scared to rep they borough
Uncle murda I'm a rep to the fullest
Like Shyne in the club I throw BULLETS BULLETS!!!

[Outro: Fabolous]
Ha son!!! It's a like it or not thing, nah mean?
This one is for Brooklyn, I'm in my Bed-Stuy fly you know
Bushwick sick, I walk that East New York walk, Brownsville grill
Got my Fort Greene lean, Ha Ha, Clinton Hills chill, Red Hook look
That Flatbush push, nah mean Cypress Hill feel
Crown Heights tight with it, The Williamsburg swerve
Coney Island stylin on 'em, Canarsie flossin
