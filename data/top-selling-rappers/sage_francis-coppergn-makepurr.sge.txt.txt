[Verse 1]
I was a lot more comfortable being vulnerable and open
When I was younger and it wasn't clear if I was or wasn't joking
But so much is broken, just like fuck it, the fix is in
If i can't hide in plain sight anymore I'll just stay hidden
It's been a minute since I left this domicile
No need to change my outfit, I rock it like it's going out of style
It's not in style? Ain't no one here to tell me otherwise
It gets more difficult to stay inside during the summertime
But most of the time it's just like any other time
Avoid personal interaction and human touch, shut the blinds
It's been a while since I left this bachelor pad
I need to go to the market soon cause the food is going bad
The food is bad. I found it's difficult to just cook for one
With healthy recipes, well, depending on what book they're from
If you want to eat healthy you gotta dirty some dishes
The frozen dinners quickly ready to serve and it's so delicious
It's not delicious, it's disgusting, but it satiates the hunger with a quickness
And hey, at least it's something, at least it's something
At most it's nothing, fuck's wrong with me? I don't know, I'm just adjusting
It's been a month since I left this cabin
The doctor was worried about a fever and other difficulties I've been having
She called me on Christmas, that was my gift
She was worried I might die, I said âI might die? No shitâ

[Verse 2]
It's been forever since I said something that I can't wiggle free from
If there's anything I cherish in this self-inflicted prison, it's freedom
Comes at a cost so I'm private to a fault til I default
On the loan for home, it's actually more like a vault
No one knows the combo but little old me
The head honcho, the holder of the key
Alone, but never lonely
It's been a millennia since I left this dominion
Been in the company of any women
At least I got my kittens
Spent more cash on my cat than I did myself
When he stopped eating, I took him to the vet so they could check his health
They put a feeding tube into his neck
I said âPlease let this work cause if it doesn't I got nothing leftâ
I didn't say that, but they saw that. Cat had my tongue
I didn't speak at all, they told me to call back
What, it wasn't weird I did nothing but stand right there?
With a "fix this, money's no object" type stare
It's been a year since I stepped into anyone else's private quarters
I've been busy self-diagnosing disorders
First world problems, yeah, USA, number one
Top of the world, I'm in a tux and cummerbund
Welcome everyone to the party of the century
It's sure to be one for the books, no doubt, medical ones especially

[Outro]
My 20's were a roar, my 30's were a blur
My 40's, I'm not so sure, but I'mma make 'em purr
My 20's were a roar, my 30's were a blur
My 40's, I'm not so sure, but I'mma make 'em purr
My 20's were a roar, my 30's were a blur
My 40's I'm not so sure, but I'mma make 'em purr
And I'mma make 'em purr, but, but I'mma make 'em purr
I'mma make 'em purr
