[Lil Wayne talking]
Ok I'm finally perfect, ya know
Yall already know what it is and if you don't
Then the great Mannie Fresh will enlighten you

[Hook: Mannie Fresh]
Ladies and gentlemen, pimps and playas
Half ass rappers and true rhyme sayers
This is the Carter, so hold onto your teenage daughter
Because this is the Carter, a lot more rich and a whole lot smarter
Wayne in ya brain young Carter
Wayne in ya brain young Carter

[Lil Wayne]
Who am I, young wizzle fa shizzle
Flow sicker than a third floor in hospitals
My charm starburst, my watch skittles
I'm hot sizzle, what up hot bizzle
Holla at a playa, I'm sorta like BD
Yall can't stop my dribble, or block the lay-ups
Soft top the Coupe, mami pop her too
Don't chase the feelin baby girl let it come to you
Remove the ceiling on the girl now she comfortable
I'ma world class G mami fuck wit dude
I got Lazy-Boy bank that's comfort low
I'ma offense coordinator run the shoe
You watch your grill what you ought to do
Fore' your ribs get barbecued
And my ribs is showin I say I'm starving dude
This, this, this, this, this is the Carter dude
What up Reel, c'mon

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne}
I'm the Birdman Birdman Jr. bitch
I be high in the sky shit on you and yo bitch
I be flyer than your guy nigga lose the prick
Now if ya follow everything just grab a wing
And we could sssssshhhhhhhh
All the way down to the mall and bet I buy it all
Young Mar' picture the broad lick
All the way down to the balls then she wipe it off
If getting money is wrong I ain't right at all
I young money a car I just write it off
I'm the boss of my own shit, I'm my own click
I would say fuck ya but go and get ya own dick
Get ya game up boy hustle harder
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this
Get ya game up boy hustle harder
