Don't stop
Don't stop that rap
Too Short
And i don't stop rappin'
Just don't stop
Too Short
I don't stop rappin'
Don't stop that rap

Well I'm Sir Too Short
The true MC
Fresh again with the brand new beat
The big bank roller, I know whats happening
I get on the mike and I don't stop rappin'

Don't stop
Don't stop that rap
Too Short
I don't stop rappin'

My rap don't stop, you know it can't
I get on the mic and i make big bank
Unlike some rappers that i know
Trying to get no, but that don't go
I'm that rapper, Sir Too Short
I know you've heard my name before
And if you haven't, now you have
Sir Too Short don't stop that rap

Don't Stop
I don't stop rappin
Too Short
Don't stop that rap

I'm so rough so tough when I talk my stuff
I don't stop rappin cuz I'm too tough
Telling you rappers what it's all about
Most MC's are played out
But not Too Short, I'm the best
You know Too Short is so so Fresh
If that's not short, your mind is snapping
The best is fresh cause I don't stop rappin'

Don't Stop
Don't Stop Rappin'
Too Short
I don't stop rappin'

I'm Sir Too Short, the rapping man
I'm a cold MC and i know I am
I'm the big time rapper from East Oakland
Into music and making fans
I love young ladies who love my rhymes
Cuz what they say is right on time
The only MC with fresh hits
It's Sir Too Short, he never quits
That's so so true, what they say
I hear those words every day
Cause I'm an MC rapper who gives you more
The big time rapper, Sir Too Short

Don't Stop
Don't stop rappin'
Too Short
I don't stop rappin

Why do rappers rap like me
Because I rap originally
I never ever will, sing your rap
I'll leave it to you and it's just like that
I sing my rap and I know you like
The way Sir Too Short rocks the mic
The sucker MC's don't even front
Even though Too Short is what they want
Cause what i say is well prepared
I look at a rapper and I make him scared
Scared to battle, the cold cold capper
I'll even be part on a female rapper

Don't stop
Don't stop rappin'
Too Short
I don't stop rappin'

C A L I F O R
N I A and a superstar
That what it is, that's what i see
California life was made for me
Born and raised in the Golden State
MC rapper and you know I'm great
Just cooling out, acting shy
I got my mic and my rap won't stop

Don't stop
Don't stop rappin'
Too Short
Don't stop that rap

I met a freak named Jiggle G
Took her on a date and spent one penny
She bought me dinner, I bought her gum
Took her to my house to have some fun
I said "Jiggle G, your so fresh
You look so fine with your big big breasts"
I spit my game to her so tough
Sir Too Short was coming up
I did just what I wanted to
But when I finished what did I do
I took her home, real real fast
I charged her up for wasted gas
I knew just what she had to say
Lets get together on our next pay day
Cuz like I said, I know whats happening
And you know too cause I don't stop rappin'

Don't Stop
Don't stop rappin'
Sir Too Short
Spit that rap

Oh yes baby, I'm the most
Sir Too Short from the West Coast
My rap don't stop, it never could
I'm known all in your neighborhood
As an MC rapper, right on time
Sucker MC's don't sing my rhymes
Cuz if they do, I'll be slapping
Sucker MC's cuz I'm all about rappin'

Don't stop
I don't stop rappin'
Too Short
Don't stop that rap

MC rappers, from the O
You talk about Short, but you don't know
If you rap original
I might kick back and watch your show
But if I did what would I see
A so fake and imitating sucka MC
In my face trying to rap like me
But none of you suckas can rock that beat
Cuz you stand there looking like a sap
And in your rap I hear my rap
The sucka MC must want my fame
Cuz he didn't stop rappin' till he heard my name

Don't stop
I don't stop rappin'
Too Short
Don't stop that rap

I'm Sir Too Short on the mic
Gonna tell ya what kind of girls Too Short likes
I like those girls that are real real fine
Thick young tenders, yours and mine
It's not all about getting that steak
Cuz what is a girl without a lot of bank
A bump and a grind and she's on her knees
The way it is now you might catch a disease

Don't stop
Don't stop that rap
Sir Too Short
Don't stop that rap

I don't stop rappin', just don't stop
Don't stop rappin' don't stop don't stop
Too Short, so fresh
I'll show you how the game comes from the west
Cuz you never ever knew that it was going on
Till a brother like me put it in a song
And I'm always fresh, never the same
Just don't stop that fishes game

Don't stop
Don't stop that rap
Too Short
Don't stop that rap

I'm Sir Too Short, I'm that MC
Fresh again, with the beat
I'm the big bank roller, I know whats happening
I get on the mic and I don't stop rapping

Don't stop
I don't stop rapping
Too Short
Don't stop that rap
Don't stop rapping
Don't stop that rap
