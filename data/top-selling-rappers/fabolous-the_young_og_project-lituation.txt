[Intro]
Yeah... {"money, money, chain, situation"}
{"Money, money, chain, situation"}
Let's get it

[Chorus: Fabolous]
My current situation a lituation
My current situation a lituation
Don't keep that money waitin', it get impatient
You niggas get to hatin', you get ovations
Bottles on the way, lituation
Models in the face, lituation
When I come around it goes down

{"Money, money, chain, situation"}

[Fabolous]
Yeah, it's a movie, get your Goobers, nigga
Yeah, it gets deep, get ya scuba, nigga
Uhh, I got the swipers in the gun shop
Yeah, I got the shooters in the uber nigga
Woo~! Everything brand new, my nigga
Yeah, Lord Jamar, Grand Puba nigga
Uhh, they callin' me Fidel Castro/cash flow
Yeah, and the link come from Cuba, nigga
Woo~! Team plastic like the ass shots
Plastic Glock 9 get ya ass shot
Dream Team, gold chain, match watch
And the bad bitches be the mascot
Yeah, got your BM in my BM nigga
Yeah, she got +Taken+, word to Liam nigga
Ha! We ain't gotta be a hundred deep (huh)
I'd rather 10 lions than a hundred sheep (huh)

[Chorus]

{"Money, money, chain, situation"}

[Fabolous]
Yeah, this shit different, nigga
Yeah, I can't explain it's just different, nigga
Yeah, this is hood gettin' money rap
Yeah, this a million on a Giffy, nigga
Woo~! This is stuntin' at the baby shower
Yeah, and it all came from baby powder
I buy her Rosé, you buy your lady flowers
Special thanks goes to the haze and sour
Respect brought the money than it gave me power
But sneak dissin' always been a fav of cowards
Aww, you don't wanna take it there
Where I'm from all they do is take it there
I came from no space wasn't safe
Now it's like no space in a safe
I do it +B.I.G+ and light skin my new +Faith+
And we skip to my lou in that new Wraith, ahh!

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
When I come around it goes down {*3X*}
Ay.. it goes down {*2X*}
... Lituation {*3X*}
When I come around it's a lituation
