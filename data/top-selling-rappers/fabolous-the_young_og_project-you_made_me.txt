[Intro: Fabolous] + (Tish Hyman)
I think we all try to be good people
But it's just thing you go through, that make you who you are
Yeah, nigga this is how you made me (this is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me)
(This is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me)
Yeah, nigga this is how you made me (this is how you made me)
(This is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me)

[Chorus: Fabolous] + (Tish Hyman)
Hold up, last time I trust a nigga he betrayed me
Last time I trust a bitch she played me
Pardon me if I've been on one lately
Yeah, this is how you niggas made me
(This is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me) this is how you made me {*4X*}

[Fabolous]
Thinkin' 'bout Sent from my iPhone
Left me for some light-skinned cat with a Mercedes (what?!)
Back then I didn't have no whip, had to upgrade me (uh)
Now I got those white boy M's, she ain't as shady
Well karma is a bitch baby (yeah)
Oh you wasn't tryna chill hoes? (Remember that?)
One day karma kicks you in the ass (oh yeah)
And I hope she wearin' steel toes
Tried to have my head all twisted, won't let 'em braid me (nah)
I just gotta be who I be, don't let it jade me (nah)
Life gave me lemons, it's time to lemonade me (uh-huh)
Music to my ears, the lies just serenade me (hold up)
And what they done to me, I done done it to the next (it's my turn)
What goes around is comin' to you next (always comin' baby)
I dress like I'ma run into my ex (ay)
And every time I run into her flex, uh

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Your boy tried to fuck me over, thought we was homies
Guess he was a h-o-e when I said homies (yeah)
Niggas get some money then act like they don't know me
Got a new phone, cut off the old phonies
They ain't never pick up for me when I used to call
And they ain't never pass the 'Roc when they used to ball
And they ain't never help me up when I used to fall
Kept tryna do it big, fuck gettin' used to small
After the success it's like yes they used to know me
Now it ain't no 'Neneh nigga, I got Naomi (woo!)
Shoulda paid attention before you nigga owe me (uh)
Since you down there on your knees, go ahead and blow me
Suck a dick, tell a hater suck a dick (tell 'em)
Just a hood nigga that hit a fuckin' lick (tell 'em)
I keep my head up and I ain't never duckin' shit (tell 'em)
I'm self made, I don't owe a motherfucker shit, boy

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tish Hyman]
Ohh-ohh ohhh
Yeah-eah ohhh, yeah-eah ohh-ohh
Yeah-eah ohhh, yeah-eah ohhh
This is how you made me, niggas say I'm actin' crazy
But this is how you made me so don't try to change me, yeahhh
But nigga this is how you made me, yeah

Nigga, nigga this is how you made me
Oh oh oh-ohh, oh oh oh-ohh oh-oh
