Song:   I Was Zero
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If it wasn't for the bass, I wouldn't need these hearing aids
If it wasn't for mistakes, I probably wouldn't be here today

10 years ago I was 22
20 years ago I was 12
30 years ago I was 2

But when I came out my momma I was zero
When I came out my momma I was zero [x3]
I was zero when I came out my momma, and now everybody knows

In the before life, I was undead
I was home schooled, there were no rules
But I gave it all up, just for the chance to go public
A celestial scarecrow dancing with the puppets
A tug in my gut, I'm carrying the world in my stomach
I'm a surrogate mother-fucker the girls love it
Birth the suffix and cut the visible string
Controls much more than a physical thing
I was born into it, and before I knew it
I saw the students of poor gettin' hauled off to war
The law of Judas in the land of the king's tax
Partaking the Eucharist, then demand your kick-backs
Spiritual wrist slap, please pass the sacrament
Ask if big bad black Jesus was African
Selling a click track, call it a soul-clap
It's all in how you package it
The power of a magic trick
Immaculate concepts, lost in the land of the cross
I'm standing off with a man of the cloth
he knows the ins and out's and all I wants the outs
hes selling real estate for some place in the clouds
But I'm not investing in intellectual property
Inventing gender-bending technology
Because maybe everybody needs to just become a sexual oddity
Leaving birth to the test tubes and death to the lottery
There's no one stopping me, I've gotta be self-regulating
Wealth is escalating, but my poverty was entertaining
I'm debating, the value of a caste system
I'm cash backed for wars and wars funded by my tax income
I find my part of the problem in part of me
There's always been a difference between what I am and what I wanna be

It's either Jihadist freak or Jesus seamster
I heard god is cumming and shes a screamer

I couldn't understand what she was telling me
Why everyone thinks that they're their own worst enemy
I followed the manual and I swallowed the skeleton key
And it unlocked the hell in me

(So this is my gift to god!) Rippin' at my dick like a tourniquet, syphilis!
(This is my gift to god!) I'm jumpin' out the cake, naked with a shank
(This is my gift to god!) Unwrap the package confetti made of maggots
(This is my gift) You call that talent? here's your image back, you can have it

10 years ago I was 22
20 years ago I was 12
30 years ago I was 2

When I came out my momma I was zero [x4]
I was zero when I came out my momma, and now everybody knows [x2]

If it wasn't for the bass, I wouldn't need these hearing aids
If it wasn't for mistakes, I probably wouldn't be here today [x2]
